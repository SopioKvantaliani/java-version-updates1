1. When you write code, should be understandable;
2. Everything in Java starts, from creating variables; Concept is the same;
examples:
    String str = "Apple"; //Type Primitive, reference name, value = String
    Dish dish = new Dish(); //Class Type,reference name, value = dish object
    Stream<Dish> dishStream = DishData.getAll().stream(); //Stream Interface Type, reference name, value = stream

We are following same structure.

3. Reactive Programming (Asynchronous programming):
         - in Java is a technique for parallel programming  that lets teams distribute
           work and build application features separately from the primary application thread.

4. Interview Preparation:
   Cheat Sheet = Method and what that method does. Notes for us to print and put visible to review
   Chapter Knowledge Checklist  = Review and if you know well check in the list
   FlashCards
   Stream Task

5. Utility Class = Static Method = We call method directly through class name;
