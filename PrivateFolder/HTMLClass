How the internet works?
    WebBrowser -> Internet ->Request for web page - Web Server
    The only purpose of the web browsers is to interpret data;
    right click and click "view page source"
    right click and "inspect"

Web Application Architecture consist in 3 layers:
    = Front End (What we see - HTML, CSS and Javascript)
    = Back End (Business Logic)
    = DataBase ()

Database:
    = database is an organized collection of data
    = Storage that stores information in an organized manner, that is easy to reach when needed.

What is HTML:
    = HTML stand for HyperText Markup Language;
    = HTML is not a programming language, it is a markup language.
    = A markup language is used to control the presentation of the data.
    = HTML is often names as the structure, or the skeleton of a WebApp.
How to write HTML Files?
    = .html extension tells your browser that this is an html file, treat it as such.
    = Web Browsers are HTML files reader mostly.

What is CSS, Why we need it?
   = You give style to HTML using CSS;
   = you can not create element wth CSS. you can only give style to an existing element.
   = e.g. Skeleton is HTML and making Appearance is HTML+CSS;

JavaScript
   = JavaScript is a scripting language.
   = Allows your website to actually do things, and have behavior.
    e.g. "Do some calculations";
         "Load new data from a page";
         "change color when user clicks to come specific button";

Web Element is each of piece on the web page. Basically, every single box, button, text, image, link, etc you see on the webpage is webElement;
Tags <tagName>   in between text   </tagName>
Tags are how HTML defines different areas and sections of the document;

Structure of HTML:

Title = name on the tab;
HTML headings are defined with the <h1></h1> to <h6></h6>;
h1 is used for main heading;
h2 is used for subheadings and so forth it becomes smaller and smaller;
command S = refresh changes
Lorem ipsum = placeholder text; lorem +tab

Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules:
hr +tab = Printed Line
br/> = Line break tag (new Line)
</p> = gap between lines
<strong> Bold Text </strong>
<em><u> underlined Italic </u></em>
